# IMDB CLONE
This is a website which allows users to sign up, login, search for movies, add ratings and comments and even upload new movies to the database.
This project was assigned as a group task in our SEF class during Software Engineering course @ RMIT University

## Technologies used
This project runs locally without using any remote databases or such  
We have decided to use:  
1) Django framework to manage the backend
2) SQLite3 for the local database

## Instructions to run
1) Ensure Django and Python have been installed on your machine
2) Run "python manage.py runserver" to initiate the local server
3) Access the port on any browser to view the website
